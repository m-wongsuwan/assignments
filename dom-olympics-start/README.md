### **Qualifier**

Your first task is to use pure JavaScript to insert a header to the top of this page. It should look like this:

The HTML for the header's container exists but the header and the name don't exist yet.

Feel free to change `.style` or use `.name` or `.header` classes from the CSS file.

Notice that your name needs to be a different color. Wrapping text in a `span` tag is a great way to do this.

### **Bronze**

There's some sub par conversation going on in this messaging app. You have two tasks to help give it either a clean slate, or a positive start.

- Write some custom JavaScript to automatically change the words of the conversation to something fun and good.
- Write some JavaScript that will wait until the user clicks the "clear" button, and then clears out all conversation.

### **Silver**

Themes!

- Use the drop down to write some JavaScript that will notice when the drop down has changed and then changes the background colors of the messages accordingly.
- Feel free to edit the HTML `<select>` tag to make it more usable or elaborate. Mo themes, mo fun.

### **Gold**

- Be able to add more messages using the form at the bottom.

EXTRA CREDIT

- Every other messaged will be posted on the right in one color, and the next on the left the other color.
